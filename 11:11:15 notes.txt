OBJECTIVES:

 - send results to array (test array prints, large array does not)


FIREBASE:

need a service to interact with the database?

move the NEW firebase reference to the factory

do we split the DB into 10 separate DBs so it runs quicker? (do both ways to see which is quicker)

try giving the json objects KEYS to see if that helps load time

11/20 THOUGHTS:

populations should be 0, not NULL, as they are now

need to write specs!
