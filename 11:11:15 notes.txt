OBJECTIVES:

 - have 5 separate number inputs that are data-bound to the zipCode array and will update live as the user changes the numbers (will need ng-model for this)

 - may need to query the DB instead of instantiating it all in the factory

 - try giving the json objects KEYS to see if that helps load time
