OBJECTIVES:

 - have 5 separate number inputs that are data-bound to the zipCode array and
   will update live as the user changes the numbers (will need ng-model for this)

 - may need to query the DB instead of instantiating it all in the factory

 - try giving the json objects KEYS to see if that helps load time

 - re-structure php write to file so that each number of the zip code is stored
   in a separate key so that it can be bound to the zipCode array in progress, so that live DB queries can take place

CURRENTLY WORKING ON/THOUGHTS:

 - utilizing indexOn method and rules in Firebase

 - JSON objects need keys

 - zips_nebraska.json us current working test file & draw from zipcodes.json

 - setup fake array in the model to work out the functionality for the front end in angular

 - possibility: have an individual reset button for each number?

 - utilize editing ng-show & ng-hide functionality?

 - get rid of lat & long in main DB to narrow scope of project & improve time

 - ng-change !!!!!
