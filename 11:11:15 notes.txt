OBJECTIVES:

 - send results to array (test array prints, large array does not)

 - have 5 separate number inputs that are data-bound to the zipCode array and will update live as the user changes the numbers

 - need a service to interact with the database?

 - move the NEW firebase reference to the factory

 - do we split the DB into 10 separate DBs so it runs quicker? (do both ways to see which is quicker)

 - try giving the json objects KEYS to see if that helps load time

11/20 THOUGHTS:

 - populations should be 0, not NULL, as they are now

 - need to write specs!
