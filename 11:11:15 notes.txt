OBJECTIVES:

 - have 5 separate number inputs that are data-bound to the zipCode array and
   will update live as the user changes the numbers (will need ng-model for this)

 - may need to query the DB instead of instantiating it all in the factory

 - try giving the json objects KEYS to see if that helps load time

 - re-structure php write to file so that each number of the zip code is stored
   in a separate key so that it can be bound to the zipCode array in progress, so that live DB queries can take place
