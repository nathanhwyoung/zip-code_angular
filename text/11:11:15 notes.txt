OBJECTIVES:

 - have 5 separate number inputs that are data-bound to the zipCode array and
   will update live as the user changes the numbers (will need ng-model for this)

 - try giving the json objects KEYS to see if that helps load time

 - re-structure php write to file so that each number of the zip code is stored
   in a separate key so that it can be bound to the zipCode array in progress, so that live DB queries can take place

CURRENTLY WORKING ON/THOUGHTS:

 - utilizing indexOn method and rules in Firebase

 - JSON objects need keys

 - zips_nebraska.json us current working test file & draw from zipcodes.json

 - setup fake array in the model to work out the functionality for the front end in angular

 - possibility: have an individual reset button for each number?

 - utilize editing ng-show & ng-hide functionality?

 - get rid of lat & long in main DB to narrow scope of project & improve time

 - need to refactor change function so there's only one that receives the number of the input changed

 - still need to move DB connection back to factory (or service??)

 - how did previous work load new content into new partials? asking for the newGuess method to load the guesses.html page
    (look at learnhow to program)



    take out of scope

    assign into ind. arrays
